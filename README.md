# django_template

a Django project with some opinionated defaults.

## Usage (naming your app)

There are three places the app's name is written:

- main app directory name
- `APP_BASE_DIR` in `manage.py`
- `APP_NAME` in `<APP_BASE_DIR>/APP_NAME.py`

In this template, these are set to 'django_template'. They need to all be set to the same value as each other.
